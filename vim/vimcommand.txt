grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'

-l can be added to just give the file name of matching files

--exclude, --include, --exclude-dir flags could be used for efficient searching

grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
grep --exclude=*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
grep --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
